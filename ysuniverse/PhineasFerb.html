  <p class="desc">The series follows stepbrothers Phineas Flynn and Ferb Fletcher during summer vacation. Every day, the boys undertake the construction of a grand project, or embark on a spectacular adventure, to make the most of their time on vacation.</p>

    <p><span class="desc">Phineas and Ferb.</span> Phineas Flynn is a young boy in the Flynn-Fletcher family. As an incurable optimist, Phineas constantly looks on the brighter side of things. He is also extremely smart, creative, persistent, and able to endeavor in immensely large projects and activities with the help of his step-brother. His hospitality is a driving force behind many of his plans. <br> Ferbs "Ferb" Fletcher is a British child of the Fletcher family. Ferb speaks very rarely, but is not actually shallow as others may assume. He is very courageous and has the ability to think quickly and stay calm in the midst of desperate scenarios. A notable skill of his is a technical and technological proficiency he shares with his stepbrother, which he can easily take advantage of and build almost anything he chooses to.</p>

    <p><span class="desc">Candace.</span> Candace Gertrude Flynn is the 15-year-old sister of Phineas Flynn and the step-sister of Ferb Fletcher. The eldest child of the Flynn-Fletcher household, she spends large portions of her time striving, but never succeeding to get her brothers in trouble for the things they do every day.</p>

    <p><span class="desc">Linda.</span> Linda Flynn-Fletcher (usually addressed and credited as "Mom" or "Mrs Flynn-Fletcher" is the mother of Phineas and Candace Flynn, and the stepmother of Ferb Fletcher. Linda is often irked when Candace tries to get her attention and show her something she knows she won't see. During such times, it is difficult for her to take her daughter seriously. However, this doesn't appear to affect her trust for Candace as the eldest Flynn child as she has willingly left Candace in charge of the household during her trips with Lawrence.</p>

    <p><span class="desc">Heinz.</span> Heinz Doofenshmirtz, also known as Dr. Doofenshmirtz, is a 47 year old evil scientist hailing from the country of Drusselstein. He is the head of Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated, and he tends not to be evil in the traditional sense, but rather overly dramatic, eccentric and generally clueless. His usual lair is an office building that he apparently owns, though he's worked from other locations when necessary for his plans. His nemesis is Perry the Platypus and it is often cited that the two enjoy loathing each other and presumably have for years. Despite this, Doofenshmirtz is unable to recognize him unless he is wearing his secret agent hat.</p>

    <img src="images/perry.png" alt="Perry">
    <p><span class="desc">Perry.</span> Perry the Platypus, code named Agent P, or simply Perry, is Phineas and Ferb's pet platypus, who, unbeknownst to his owners, lives a double life as a secret agent for the O.W.C.A. (The Organization Without a Cool Acronym a.k.a. "The Agency"), a secret spy organization that employs animal spies. It is shown that Perry spends part of the night sleeping in Phineas's bed and at some point switches over to Ferb's so as to not show preference or play favorites with any one of them ("Oh, There You Are, Perry"). Also, he sometimes appears in the mornings on Candace's bed, even though it annoys her to no end.</p>
